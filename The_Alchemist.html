	<p><b>The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of coloured beads. The room's furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and two chairs.<br>The woman sat down  and told him to be seated as well. then she took both of his hands in hers, and began quietly to pray.<br>It sounded like the a Gypsy prayer. the boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they had no flock of sheep. people said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It was also said that they had a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away to their mysterius camps, made them their slaves. as a child, the boy had always been fightened to death that he would be captured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took his hands in hers. But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to reassure himself. he didn't want his hand to begin trembling, showing the old woman that he was fearful. he recited an Our Father silently.<br>"Very interesting" said the woman, never taking her eyes from the boy's hands, and then she fell silent.the boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away.<br>"I didn't come here to have you read my palm," he said already regretting having come. He thought for a moment that it would be better to payher fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was giving too much importance to his recurrent dream.<br>"You came so that you could learn about your dreams," said the old woman. "And dreams are the language of God. When he speaks in our language, i can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in the langauge of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But, whatever it is, I'm going to charge you for the consultation."<br>Another trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. A shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought, and that's what makes a shepherd's life exciting.<br>"I have had the same dream twice," he said. "I dreamed that I was in the field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to play with the animals. I don't like people to do that, because the sheep are afraid of strangers. But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them. I don't know why. I don't know how animals know the age of human beings."<br>"Tell me more about your dream," said the woman. "I have to get back to my cookin, and, since you don't have much money, I can't give you a lot of time."</b></p>
