	<p><b>They crossed the desert for another two days in silence. The alchemist had become much more cautios, because they were approaching the area where the most violent battles were being waged. As they moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.<br>It was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been ready to tell its story, but lately that wasn't true. There had been times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy of treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the endless horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.<br>"Why do we have to listen to our hearts?" the boy asked, when they had made camp that day.<br>"Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you'll find your treasure."<br>"But my heart is agitated," the boy said."It has its dreams, it gets emotional, and it's become passionate over the woman of the desert. it asks things to me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I'm thinking about her."<br>"Well, that's good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say."<br> During the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number of armed tribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The boy's heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the soul of the world, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found love and riches.<br>"My heart is a traitor," the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses."It doesn't want me to go on."<br>"That makes sense," the alchemist answered."Naturally it's afraidthat, in pursuing your dream, you might lose everything you've won."<br>"Well, then, why should i listen to my heart?"<br>"Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be thereinside you, repeating to you what you're thinking about life and about the world."<br>"You mean I should listen, even if it's treasonous?"<br>"treason is a blow that come unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you'll its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them.<br>"You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it's better to listen to what it has to say. That way, you'll never have to fear an unanticipated blow."<br>The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, anf forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. "Even though I complain sometimes," it said, "it's because I'm the heart of a person, and people's heart's are that way. People are afraid to pursure their most important dreams, because they feel that they don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to achieve them. We, theior hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but weren't, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sand. Because when these things happen, we suffer terribly."<br>"My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer," the boy told the alchemist one night as they loked up at the mooless sky.<br>"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with god and with eternity."<br>"Every second of the search is an encounter with god," the boy told his heart. "When I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because I've knownthat every hour was a part of the dream that i would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I've discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve"</b></p>
